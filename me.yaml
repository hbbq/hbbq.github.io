brief: 
- I've worked with system development since the year 2000. In later years the focus has been more on solution architecture, but quite some amount of system development occurs still
- I'm solution oriented, I have a sixth sense about forseeing what could be problematic
- I'm a fast learner and will quite quickly feel familiar in new systems and solutions
- If any problems occur, I will easily find the probable root cause    

notsobrief: 
- The story begins with me being born and raised in the small town of Alingås, less than an hours travel from Gothenburg, where I still live to this day.
  I've always had an interest for technology and I got hooked on programming early when I got to play around with BASIC on the Luxor ABC80 in the 80s.
  The ABC80 was later switched for an Amiga 500 that I used for gaming and quite some programming in AMOS BASIC.
  In high school I had som courses in BASIC, Pascal, C++, Assembler and Machine code.

- I newer thought about actually working as a programmer but as it happened I joined some classes after High School where i learnt Visual Basic, SQL, ASP, etc.
  That led to me getting an internship at Part Trap where I helped create customer specific and standard solutions; both application and web sites.
  The first years we programmed in Visual Basic and classic ASP but we fully embraced the .Net-environment from it's first release.
  Over the years at Part Trap we embraced C# and dabbled with a plethora of techniques; WebForms, MVC, VB.Net, Knockout.js, Angular.js, Azure, ...
  I stayed there for many years and besides programming I also took care of Networking, Hardware, Server, Build servers, Deployments, Installations and some customer support.

- But after one and a half decade it was time for me to get some new challenges so I got a job as system developer at Alektum Group.
  The technologies were mostly familiar as most things were built on the Microsoft stack. But the systems and the domain was new.
  But... I am a fast learner and it didn't take long before I was well versed in both new and legacy solutions.

- After some years my role shifted to more of a solutions architect. I really enjoy seeing the whole picture and coming up with solutions that work well with current and future systems.
  This were some happy years. I really felt that my skills, my thinking and my personality got to a great use at Alektum Group

- But as it sometimes is; it was once again time to do something new...

- So, me and a couple of guys that I've gotten to know over the years started our own IT consultancy business.
  We offer our services, our skills and our experience for the benefit of our customers. We got some 100 years combined experience in software development and most of them in the fintech domain.

- So... this is the "short" story of how I ended up where I am today

- "\"Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end\""
